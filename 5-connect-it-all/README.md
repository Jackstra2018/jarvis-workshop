# Connect it All - Team Workshop Tasks

## Goal

The main goal of these these Connect It All Team Tasks is to connect all of your previously completed tasks together and make your Jarvis understand you and pull out a simple component from the Serverless Application Repository and deploy it.

### Task list

The task list varies on the completed work. If you haven't done DynamoDB tasks, then you only need to do the first three task groups.

#### Important note

If you want to focus on completing it, we suggest that while you're doing the CloudFormation task, one member of your team connects the code between the Alexa Intent and Comprehend or Comprehend and AppRepo. That way, you can test out their integrations much faster.

#### Tasks

You will need to have:

1. [Create or Update the SAM template file](./1-create-template)
2. [Connect your your Add service Alexa Intent to Comprehend](./2-connect-alexa-to-comprehend)
3. [Connect the resulting Input Output groups to your AWS Serverless App Repo Tasks](./3-connect-to-app-repo)
4. [Connect your Alexa Intents to DynamoDB](./4-connect-to-dynamodb) (optional task)

Each of the tasks are more detailed inside their corresponding folders here.
